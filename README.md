# OrbitalSimulator
Simulates orbits in 2D.

Orbital Mechanics are seriously intersting. Even in 2D.

Features: 
- Simulates the orbits of the major bodies in the solar system
- Connects to a database containing data on asteroids.
    -  Extracts asteroid data, 
    -  shifts asteroid orbits to the same orbital plane, 
    -  translates the asteroid orbits so aphelion occurs directly above the sun.
    -  populates the simulation with asteroids 
 - Speed up / Slow down
 - Pan left, right, up, down
 - Zoom in / Zoom out
 - Reset simulation to day 0, return objects to initial state.
 - Change mass and size of simulation objects while the simulation is running
