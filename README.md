# OrbitalSimulator
Simulates orbits in 2D.

Orbital Mechanics are seriously intersting. Even in 2D.


20/5 Essentially reset the repository so have lost all previous activity. Now using Eclipse as opposed to sublime text.

Current Version: 2.1

Planned Changes for 2.2
- use a game loop to control the simulation
- change simulation interval from a day to an hour
- use images for planets rather then filled circles

Future Objectives
- Use more advanced drawing techniques, e.g iterating through pixels for rendering. 
- Create random scenarios that are inclided to produce interesting situations
